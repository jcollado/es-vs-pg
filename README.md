Elasticsearch vs. PostgreSQL
============================

This repository contains a small script to compare Elasticsearch vs. PostgreSQL
full-text search performance.

The script runs as follows:

In the log output of the script it will be displayed the time it took to
insert/index the records and the time it took to run the queries.
